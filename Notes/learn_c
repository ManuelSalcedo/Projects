static - 
By default, variables are local to the scope in which they are defined. 
Variables can be declared as static to increase their scope up to file containing them. 
As a result, these variables can be accessed anywhere inside a file.

static function - 
By default, functions are global in C. If we declare a function with static, 
the scope of that function is reduced to the file containing it.
